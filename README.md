# Corner Grocer Inventory App
This is a mock grocery store inventory tracking app made for learning purposes. It provides a console-based menu to choose between printing a formatted list of items purchased that day, finding out how many items of a particular type were purchased, and printing a text-based histogram of purchases. It features C++/Python interop.
